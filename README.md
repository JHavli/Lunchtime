lunchtime

This project is a web application for managing dishes in a lunchtime menu. It is implemented using the Spring framework, specifically Spring MVC. The project consists of a controller, a mapper, and a model class. The DishController handles HTTP requests and interacts with the DishService to perform operations on dishes. The DishMapper defines SQL queries using MyBatis annotations for retrieving and inserting dishes into a database. The Dish model class represents a dish with its attributes such as ID, dish name, and price. The HTML template uses Thymeleaf for dynamic content rendering and displays a table of available dishes with their names and prices. The application allows users to add new dishes through a form submission, and the added dishes are displayed in the table.
